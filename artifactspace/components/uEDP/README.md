**CIEDPC** is an ultra-lightweight, high-performance event-driven programming kernel, inspired by the **Active Object** model with additional custom enhancements. Its core objective is to achieve **"Zero-Touch Porting"**: moving the entire application logic across platforms (for example, from STM32 to Linux simulation) without modifying the core source code.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Strictly Layered Architecture:** Clear separation between App Layer - CIEDPC Core - PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer).
- **O(1) Scheduler:** Priority-based multitasking scheduler using bitmasks for fast event reaction.
- **Static Memory Pools:** Completely eliminates RAM fragmentation and guarantees deterministic behavior for real-time systems.
- **Unified Messaging System:** Automatically adapts pointer size (4-byte on 32-bit, 8-byte on 64-bit), supporting both value transfer and reference transfer (zero-copy).
- **"Shell & Core" Mechanism (TSM & FSM):**
  - **TSM (Table-driven):** Manages high-level operating modes with automatic Entry/Exit actions.
  - **FSM (Pointer-driven):** Handles detailed business logic with high flexibility.
- **Simulation Ready:** Fully supports Linux POSIX simulation to validate logic end-to-end before deploying to hardware.

## 🛠 Quick Start (Linux Simulation)

CIEDPC supports running simulations directly on Linux to validate logic.

### 1. Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- CMake (version 3.10+)

### 2. Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DPLATFORM=LINUX ..
make
```

### 3. Run Integration Test

```bash
./ciedpc_test
```

*The result will display TSM/FSM state transitions and Timer Service activity in the terminal.*

## 📖 "Shell & Core" Principle

CIEDPC solves complex logic by combining two types of state machines:

1. **TSM (Macro-level):** Manages high-level "modes" (for example: `IDLE`, `RUNNING`, `ERROR`). It automatically cleans up resources when a task changes mode via `on_exit`.
2. **FSM (Micro-level):** Manages detailed "behavior" inside each mode (for example: decoding UART packets byte-by-byte).

This mechanism completely removes tangled flag-based logic and turns the codebase into a clean, diagram-like representation of behavior.

## 📝 Documentation

Detailed information about APIs, memory pool planning, and porting to other MCUs can be found in the [User Manual (PDF)](./docs/user-manual.md). Please note that this documentation is presented in Vietnamese to better serve the local developer community, but it can be translated to English in the future if there is demand.

## Future Roadmap

The roadmap and development direction will be updated regularly in the documentation branch `docs`, file `to-do.md` to provide a clear overview of the project's evolution and upcoming features. Key points include:

- Added a development roadmap to transform CIEDPC from an EDP core into a complete OS based on Semantic Versioning standards.
- Added comparisons of CIEDPC's design evaluation with the standard QP/C model of Miro Samek.
- Added documentation to mention the design transition process from EPCB-vn AKEDP dependent to CIEDPC.
Convention: Document changes may be released as patch versions if they directly affect the release deliverable or the system's usability.
